###### What is Geometry?
It is the study of lines, shapes, angles, directions, etc.

There are three elements to basic geometry:
1. Points
2. Lines
3. [[Planes]]

###### Points
These are **specific locations in a space**. They are represented by dots "."

However, what if we wish to talk about a specific point? For that, we use naming like this:

But since these names are too long, we shorten them, like this:

We can join two points like this and form a line, or more specifically, a *line segment*.

What is the difference between a line and a line segment?

In total, there are three types of lines:
1. Line segment
2. Line
3. Rays -> goes on forever just like a line, but only in one direction
They are represented as follows:
