## What is artificial intelligence?

A machine is said to have AI if it can ==interpret data==, potentially ==learn from that data==, and use that knowledge to adapt and ==achieve specific goals==.  
_Data_ is an important term when speaking about AI.

#### History of AI

###### Dartmouth Conference

This was a conference named as [ Dartmouth Research Project on AI ](http://jmc.stanford.edu/articles/dartmouth/dartmouth.pdf) and started in 1956 by John McCarthy (father of AI). In this conference, scientists did thinking and came up with many AI concepts such as Artificial Neural Networks.

In excitement, the scientists might even have overestimated the use of AI. Such as a scientist named Marvin Minsky claimed in 1970 that "in three to eight years we will have a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being" but we know that this hasn’t been achieved even till now.

2005-2010 was the time of **AI winter**, i.e., not much advancement in AI was done during this time.

###### Developments that led to AI revolution

1.       **Increase in computing power and processing speed**: Since there was increase in computing and processing power, more data was able to be processed and AI involves a lot of data. There is Moore’s law that states that every year since 1956 number of transistors that can fit in the same space would have doubled. This has led to the increase in the processing power.

2.       **Internet and social media**

###### Working of AI

AI doesn’t automatically know what it should do and what not but it encounters multiple data-gathering events which guides it in that direction. However, AI doesn’t have senses, body or brain that can automatically judge things like humans can. These are just programs and machines.  
AI has to be provided data and it needs a powerful enough computer to interpret that data.
