###### Time Value of Money

Q. Would you rather have Rs. 100 today of Rs. 100 5 years from now?

A. This is an obvious question. I would want them today. Why so?
Because of the obvious reasons:
1. Invest Now - I might be able to invest that money today and grow it 5 years down the line
2. More expensive 5 years from now - Because of inflation, the value of my money will go down 5 years from now. I wouldn't want that
3. Uncertainty - There is risk involved. As in, will I be able to get my money back, what if something comes up and I don't get the money. Basically risk.
