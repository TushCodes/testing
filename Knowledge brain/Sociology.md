- August Comte - father of sociology
- *Sociology* is the scientific study of society and human behaviour
- A *society* is just a group of people who share a **culture** and a **territory**

What makes sociology different from other social sciences?
Like others, it is looking for patterns. But it covers broader aspects of society. (The Sociological Perspective)

###### The Sociological Perspective
- Seeing the general in the particular - Each individual forms a part of the pattern, and in looking at their individual choices, a sociologist can see elements of the whole pattern, like (seeing how a single stone fits into a mosaic)
- Seeing the strange in the familiar - many strange things that we learn as a part of society that seems familiar to us, like laughing with friends when you are not really feeling like it, just as a means of validation or saying namaste to elders. These have become a common sense for us.

But common sense doesn't always means it is right. Common sense will help us get through in the society but sociology will uncover what is the truth.
For example, till a few decades ago, it was common sense to not give equal rights to black people. But sociologically, it isn't true or right.

Sociological perspective helps us in studying sociology and understand social problems.
Example- concepts like social location, marginalization, and power and inequality

###### Social location
A way of classifying ourselves in society. ![[Pasted image 20221027100200.png]]Understanding it is important because this will influence our life and choices. 
Our social location might limit our choices. For example, gays and lesbians until a few years ago couldn't legally marry in the society. So their choice of marriage was limited by their social location.

Social location also influences what you learn and where you go in life.
For instance, whether you go to college or not is influenced by what kind of thinking related to college is there in your society. If they see it as valuable or not.

###### Marginalization
Sometimes social location might lead to **marginalization**. If a social group is marginalized it means that it occupies a position outside of the centers of power. Often racial, ethnic, sexual minorities are marginalized and they understand how power operates as they can see themselves being marginalized of it. Sociology can help us identify these problems and maybe even fix them.
